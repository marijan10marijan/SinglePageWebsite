                <h1>Web Development Made Easy</h1>
                <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                    intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                    of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A
                    more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
                    engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
                    Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>
